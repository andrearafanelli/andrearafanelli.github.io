I am a postdoc researcher at **[Amsterdam UMC](https://www.amc.nl/web/home.htm)** in the **[Translational AI Laboratory](https://trailab.nl/)** and in the **[Amsterdam Center for Computational Cardiology](https://computational-cardiology.nl/)**.

My work centres on the development of _Digital Biomarkers_ and AI-driven medical analytics. Particularly, I focus on applying AI and machine-learning techniques to biomedical data, especially in cardiology and translational medicine.

I hold a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence in February 2025 from the **[University of Pisa](https://phd-ai-society.di.unipi.it/students/andrea-rafanelli/)**.
My thesis investigated the integration of _learning and reasoning_ in agent and multi–agent systems (**neuro-symbolic AI**). 
During my Ph.D., I actively collaborated with the **[Department of Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics (DISIM)](https://www.disim.univaq.it)** of the University of l'Aquila and the **[Department of Computer Science and Engineering (DISI)](https://apice.unibo.it/xwiki/bin/view/AndreaRafanelli/)** of the University of Bologna.

From November 2023 to May 2024, I was a visiting student at the **[Learning and Reasoning](https://lr.cs.vu.nl/about/people)** group at the Vrije Universiteit of Amsterdam.
